# APS RevTex Template

APS journals stipulate that you should format your research papers using RevTex.

This template contains:

- A tex document structure with a .tex file for each section
- A devcontainer with a pre-configured environment so you don't have to install RevTex locally
- VSCode workspace config to make working with it seamless
